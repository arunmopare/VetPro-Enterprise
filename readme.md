# VetPro Enterprises

Welcome to the VetPro Enterprises project repository. This project is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React application written in TypeScript.
- **Backend**: A NestJS application written in TypeScript.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
VetProEnterprises/
├── src/
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   └── ... (React app)
│   └── backend/
│       └── ... (NestJS app)
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Frontend

The frontend is a TypeScript React application located in the `src/frontend` directory.

### Setup

Navigate to the `src/frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the React development server and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend is a TypeScript NestJS application located in the `src/backend` directory.

### Setup

Navigate to the `src/backend` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the NestJS development server and you can access the API at `http://localhost:3001` (or the port you have configured).
